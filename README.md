# Three-Phase Power System Simulation

This project is a Python-based application that simulates and visualizes a three-phase power system. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and interactive data visualization using Plotly. The application is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to understand the behavior of three-phase systems by simulating their voltage and current waveforms.

 Features

1. Three-Phase Simulation: Simulates line and phase voltages and currents based on user inputs for parameters such as line voltage, load impedance, power factor, and frequency.
2. Interactive GUI: An easy-to-use interface for entering parameters and running simulations.
3. Unit Selection: Dropdown menus for selecting units (e.g., volts or kilovolts, ohms or kilo-ohms).
4. Interactive Plots: Generates interactive waveforms for line and phase voltages and currents using Plotly.
5. Save Results: Allows saving simulation results to a CSV file for further analysis.
6. Error Handling: Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs or actions.

 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `plotly`
  - `tkinter`

 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd three_phase_simulation
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

2. Use the GUI to input the following parameters:
   - Line Voltage: Voltage between two phases (with unit selection: V or kV).
   - Load Impedance: Impedance of the load (with unit selection: 立 or k立).
   - Power Factor: Power factor of the system (cosine of the phase angle).
   - Frequency: Frequency of the system in Hz.
   - Simulation Time: Total time for the simulation in seconds.

3. Click the Simulate button to generate the waveforms.

4. To save the results, click the Save Results button and choose a file location.

 File Structure

- `three_phase_simulation_gui.py`: Main script containing the simulation logic and GUI code.

 Example

1. Input parameters:
   - Line Voltage: `400 V`
   - Load Impedance: `50 立`
   - Power Factor: `0.8`
   - Frequency: `50 Hz`
   - Simulation Time: `0.02 s`

2. Click Simulate to generate waveforms.

3. Click Save Results to export data as a CSV file.
